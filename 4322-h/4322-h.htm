INTRODUCTION
</H3>

<P>
At last, after waiting twenty leaden-winged years from the time in
which a fixed purpose was formed in me to visit the Orient, the
realization came. The year that saw the fulfillment of my cherished
ambition was definitely determined upon eight summers before it took
its place in the calendar of history. Fortune smiled upon my plan. I
was ready. My joy was akin to ecstasy.
</P>

<P>
Imagine my disappointment when, in the month of May of my chosen year,
1900, I learned that no agency would organize a tourist party to move
at a time in the summer or autumn that would suit me! There was but one
alternative&mdash;to travel independent of any organization. This I would
do. The decision to do so brought instant and happy relief.
</P>

<P>
At no time in my period of absence of five months did I meet a single
former acquaintance. I planned every move, and held myself in every way
responsible for results. The experience I thus gained in the many
countries visited I value highly. Not infrequently I found myself in
trying situations; but all ended well. To-day, in my inventory of
life's rich and helpful experiences, though it were possible for me to
do it, I would not eliminate one of these. It was a kind Providence
that denied me the luxury of a place in a modern "personally conducted"
tourist party.
</P>

<P>
A few articles descriptive of certain experiences have been written by
me for publication. Some themes I have presented on the lecture
platform a few hundred times. My auditors, universally, have been kind
in their criticisms. Many have been the requests that I write a volume
reciting the story of my travels. In response I have steadily refused.
Many books on travel have appeared in recent years, possibly too many;
but I have seen very little that has been written about the
trans-Jordanic highlands. And it is not strange, for, though multitudes
of tourists annually visit Palestine, not one person out of a thousand
of them ever goes east of the Jordan. And is it worth while? We shall
see.
</P>

<P>
On my trip I tried to identify no biblical site; I tried to locate no
city of antiquity; I dug into no mound; I disturbed no ruin. All this I
left to the geographer, the historian, and the archaeologist who had
preceded me, or who should come after me. True, with the help of my
Bible, map, guide-book, and guide, I formed opinions, and was happy in
the fitness of some of them; but, in the main, I was content to rest in
the conclusions reached by those who had studied scientifically and
reverently every hill and valley and ruin in this neglected region.
</P>

<P>
But my observation and experience no other has had. I know of no other
who mapped out or traveled the route chosen by me. I sought and
expected much; I found and experienced more. And though eight years
have passed since my journeyings in Gilead, yet so fresh is the memory
of those days that I need make but slight reference, as I write, to the
notes that were then written. Often, in recent years, I have found
myself lingering in thought on some high ridge looking out over an
extended panorama filled with sacred associations, or silently gazing
up into the strangely impressive Oriental sky by night. Even as I write
I seem to catch again a perfume-laden breeze, bearing repose to my
weary soul. And if the memory of this land seen in its desolation is so
refreshing to a foreigner, what must not the possession of the real in
the days of its fatness have been to the weary, battle-scarred
Israelites who secured permission to abide here!
</P>

<P>
So, in response to the call of my friends, and with the hope of adding
somewhat to the meager fund of information concerning a once famous
district, or, at least, to create additional interest in the territory
occupied by the tribe of Gad in the days of early allotment, I
undertake to tell the story of "My Three Days in Gilead."

"Waiting at Damascus"
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
CHAPTER I.
</H3>

<P>
Damascus! A city that numbers the years of its existence in
millenniums; that witnessed in the dawn of history the migration of
Abraham as he went out from Ur to a land not known to him, and to whom
she gave one of the best of her sons; that sent out the leper, Naaman,
to Palestine for healing and received him back whole; that hailed with
great preparations the coming of Elisha, who had previously blinded her
army at Dothan; that welcomed Saul of Tarsus in his blindness, restored
his sight, and sent him, transformed in his life, to transform Asia
Minor and classic Europe. Damascus! A city surviving an age-long
struggle with the encroaching desert&mdash;a struggle that must go on
through ages to come; but, as long as the Abana and Pharpar continue to
flow, the sands that would bury her forever in oblivion will be changed
into a soil of life-giving and life-sustaining fertility sufficient to
support her thousands of inhabitants. Damascus! A city of the long ago,
practically unchanged, where the Occidental may look to-day with
unfeigned interest upon architecture, costumes, and customs similar to
those that prevailed in the East while Greece and Rome were yet young.
Damascus! A city celebrated for a thousand years for its bazaars,
work-shops, and roses; a city so beautiful thirteen hundred years ago
that Mohammed, viewing it for the first time from a distance, is said
to have exclaimed: "Man can have but one paradise. My paradise is
heaven; I cannot enter yonder city!" a city to-day of unsurpassed
beauty, when viewed from the distance, with its white domes and slender
minarets rising above the shrubbery and trees of its thirty thousand
gardens. Here in this old city; in this historic city; in this
beautiful city; in Damascus, I greet you and extend to you an
invitation to join me in my proposed trip through Gilead.
</P>

<P>
My party as yet consists of but two persons. My dragoman, William
Barakat, of Jerusalem, in response to a telegram sent from
Constantinople, met me several days ago at Beyrout. He is a native
Syrian, talks good English, dresses like an American, (save that he
wears a red fez,) and is a Christian in faith. Before reaching this
city he has already rendered me excellent service. He is intelligent,
having attended the American College at Beyrout. I can trust him.
</P>

<P>
My arrangements with my guide are simple. He is to take me over my
desired route by best possible methods of travel; to furnish the best
of fare and lodging obtainable; to guarantee me a safe escort; and he
is to do all this within a specified time and for a stipulated price. I
did not then know how little I was asking as to fare and lodging, but
when I knew that he was fulfilling his part of the agreement I had
little cause for just complaint.
</P>

<P>
By early dawn, on October thirtieth, we had breakfasted and had bidden
good-by to all the servants about the hotel, (many of whom I did not
know to exist, but who, somehow, had learned of me, and had risen thus
early to witness my departure and to ask a fee for services that I am
quite sure some of them had had no part in rendering,) and had ordered
the driver to lose no time in reaching the station of the
Damascus-Hauran Railroad, about two miles distant. But, notwithstanding
the early hour, the streets were already crowded with people, mules,
donkeys, dogs, and other things. It was only with great effort that we
could make any headway, and at times it seemed that the crowd, angered
at our persistence, would stop us entirely in our struggle to pass
through. We did the best we could, but we missed the train. Since there
were ONLY THREE TRAINS A WEEK on that road, it meant that I must go
back to that same hotel and spend two more days in Damascus at the rate
of ten dollars a day, and then, again, on leaving, must fee those same
servants for service that I did not want, and, generally speaking, did
not get. But, though the disappointment was great, it brought
additional opportunity to study the wonders and ways of the wonderful
city wherein I was forced to remain.
</P>

<P>
A second time my dragoman prepares food for our journey; and again, on
the morning of November first, we hurry to the station. This time we do
not miss the train&mdash;we wait for it&mdash;and we wait a long time; but with
the waiting there is contentment, for, if the train move south, I, too,
am sure of going.

"Through Bashan"
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
CHAPTER II.
</H3>

<P>
At the time of this writing there is a railroad extending from Damascus
to Mecca, but at the time of my visit the terminus was at Mezarib, a
small town about fifty miles south of Damascus, near the northern
boundary-line of Gilead. It was in my plan to travel that distance by
rail; hence my presence at the city railroad station.
</P>

<P>
The ride to Mezarib, through Bashan, especially that part of it now
known as the Hauran, is one of more than ordinary interest. For the
first twenty-five miles the land is literally covered with black
basaltic rocks, as is also part of the remaining distance. How it is
cultivated I can scarcely understand, for I am sure that the American
horse could not be made to serve well here. But I was told that the
natives do cultivate it, and that they raise excellent crops of grain.
When I looked upon them at work with their crude wooden plows and brush
harrows, and then heard that they raise excellent crops of grain, I was
satisfied that the land must be very fertile; and I was reminded of a
certain humorist's remark about the fertility of some land in Kansas,
of which he said, "All you need to do is to tickle the ground with a
hoe, and it will laugh with a big harvest." Farther on the rocks almost
entirely disappear, and there is spread out a beautiful valley,
extending far to the south, whose fertility and pasturage attracted the
Israelites on their march to Canaan, and which, ever since, has caused
the name "Bashan" to be a synonym for "plenty." And, because of its
abundant production of grain, which finds a ready market in Damascus,
it has been aptly called the "granary of Damascus."
</P>

<P>
The manner in which this grain is put on the market is quite novel to
me. I see hundreds of camels loaded with large sacks of grain moving
with slow, swinging tread toward Damascus, or returning unloaded to the
desert. The camels proceed in single file, usually ten or more in a
train, and each is led by means of a rope fastened to the animal next
in front&mdash;the rope of the foremost of all being fastened to the saddle
of a donkey, on which the owner, or driver, usually rides. Many
grindstones also are shipped from this country, one large stone
constituting a load for a camel. This land is, also a great grazing
region, and for more than three thousand years Bashan has been
celebrated for its fine breed of cattle.
</P>

<P>
Some distance south of Damascus I cross the headwaters of the Pharpar
River, whose clear, sparkling water Naaman considered much more
suitable for a general's bath than the muddy water of the Jordan. At my
place of crossing an athlete could clear the stream at a single bound.
</P>

<P>
The distant scenery deserves more than a passing notice, though but
little more can be given here. Off to the west, in plain view, is Mount
Hermon, whose towering, snow-capped summit in all probability looked
upon the transfigured person of the Son of Man. To the east is the
Lejah, in, or near which is Edrei, where Og, the giant king of Bashan,
was slain in the attempt to hold his realm against the home-seeking
Israelites under the leadership of Moses. South of the Lejah are the
Hauran Mountains, now occupied by the Druses, a people of a peculiar
religious faith&mdash;a faith which is a mixture of Mohammedan, Christian,
and Zoroastrian elements. One of their beliefs is that the number of
souls in existence never varies. "Accordingly, all the souls now in
life have lived in some human form since the creation, and will
continue to live till the final destruction of the world." To them
prayer is thought to be an unwarrantable interference with the
Almighty. They, having colonized this mountain, are at present causing
the Turkish government much trouble. They number about 90,000, and are
almost continuously at war with the neighboring Bedouin tribes. And
because of the feuds which prevail here, it is expected, and I believe
is a matter of law, that all visitors to this region must have an
escort either of soldiers or Bedouins. Were not robbery and bloodshed
so prevalent in the East-Jordan country, its ruins and scenery would
attract hundreds of tourists where now but a few ever suffer their
curiosity or interest in Bible lands to turn them aside from the beaten
paths of travel. In my course I pass through a portion of the land of
which we read in Deut. 3:3-5, noted for its many "rock cities." I look
upon the ruins of a number of these, but have little opportunity for a
close examination. The most noted ruins that I see are at Sunamein and
at Mezarib. But those who have pressed farther east, and who have made
a careful study of the best preserved of these "rock cities" of Bashan,
tell us that everything about them is of stone-doors, gates, windows,
stairs, rafters, galleries, cupboards, benches, and even candlesticks.
So perfectly preserved are some of these "dead cities," that of one,
Salcah, Doctor Porter says that some five hundred of the houses are
still standing, and that "from three hundred to four hundred families
might settle in it at any moment without laying a stone or expending an
hour's labor on repairs." Of Beth-gamul another traveler says in part:
"The houses were some of them very large, consisting usually of three
rooms on the ground floor, and two on the first story, the stairs being
formed of large stones built in the house walls, and leading up
outside. The doors were, as usual, of stone; sometimes folding doors,
and some of them highly ornamental. I wandered about quite alone in the
old streets of the town&mdash;entered one by one the old houses, went
up-stairs, visited the rooms, and, in short, made a careful examination
of the whole place; but so perfect was every street, every house, every
room, that I almost fancied I was in a dream, wandering alone in this
city of the dead, seeing all perfect, yet not hearing a sound." Much of
the work in most of these cities is on such a large scale as to
indicate that the houses were built by, and intended for a race of
giants. When we think of these fortresses of strength defended by their
mighty occupants, and remember that they were probably in existence at
the time of the exodus of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, the
victories of Moses gained here become sublime.
</P>

<P>
We are nearing Mezarib. All forenoon has been consumed in covering a
distance of only about fifty miles. But by twelve o'clock we have
passed almost completely across the land where Og was king, especially
that part of his kingdom which, not long after being wrested from him
and his giant followers, was assigned to the eastern half-tribe of
Manasseh for a permanent possession.
</P>

<P>
Before leaving Beyrout my dragoman telegraphed to Jerusalem for a
muleteer and three horses to be sent to this railroad terminus. Must we
be disappointed in this! We are both solicitous. My guide is leaning
far out of the car window long before the train stops to learn, if
possible, whether or not his order has been obeyed. I watch that dark,
anxious, perplexed face with much solicitude. Ah, he smiles! The
sunshine of satisfaction chases the clouds of anxiety and doubt from
his countenance, and that dark face looks beautiful to me. He is happy,
and I share in his happiness. Our muleteer and horses are awaiting us.

CHAPTER III.
</H3>

<P>
At twelve o'clock our train stopped. I was quickly introduced to him
who had been awaiting us, and who was now to join our party&mdash;"Haleel,"
of Jerusalem. He was dressed in typical Eastern fashion, wearing the
wide pantaloons, flowing robe, and "kufiyeh"; he was apparently
twenty-five years old, dark-skinned, and blind in one eye; he could not
speak a word of English; and he was a devout Mohammedan. "Haleel, of
Jerusalem!" Notwithstanding his fantastic appearance, the name and
place of residence seemed to me a blending of mystery and sacredness. I
did not hesitate to extend a cordial greeting, and his smile of
confused interest as I tried to shake hands with him while he tried to
give me an Oriental salutation won me to him. It was his only
intelligible language to me, but it was sufficient to give me assurance
of his friendship, and I was beginning to feel that from that hour I
should need friends. The salutation that Haleel offered to me was a
quick, graceful movement of his hand toward my feet, next to his lips,
and then lightly to his forehead. I had seen the natives do this in
exchanging salutations, and now that it had been offered to me I sought
an interpretation. My guide explained that Haleel meant to tell me that
he felt so honored in meeting me, that he "would take the dust from my
feet, would kiss it, and then place it on his forehead." Beautiful
sentiment! Had I ever previously in my life been so honored in meeting
any one!
</P>

<P>
The greeting over, I noticed unusual movements about the station. Many
Turkish soldiers were there. They stood about in groups engaged in
animated conversation. Upon inquiry I learned that the feuds so common
in that region were again "on," and that the soldiers were there to
quell lawlessness. As I was the only tourist there I became an object
of special interest. Some of the men came to my dragoman, and only a
few words had passed until I knew that I was the subject of their
conversation. I could occasionally catch the word "hawadje," which
means "master," and I knew they were referring to me. Then they would
look at me and shake their heads. I was anxious to know what it all
meant, but had to be content with what my guide was pleased to tell of
it. He seemed to have gained his point, but he told me nothing except
to prepare for a hard trip, as a day's distance must be covered, if
possible, before nightfall. As we had already lost two days in
Damascus, I was not averse to trying something strenuous in order to
make up in part for that loss. I felt quite equal to the task, (though
it proved to be a severe ordeal,) when it was explained to me that it
would require a ride of more than forty miles to reach a safe
halting-place for the night. My guide had planned it; and I was
committed to the plan.
</P>

<P>
After a hurried lunch, eaten in the tent of an Arab, I prepare for,&mdash;I
know not what. I put on my leggings and head-gear. Then I give over my
luggage, which consists of a suit-case, hand-grip, umbrella, and
alpenstock, to Haleel. I keep my overcoat, not because the weather is
cold,&mdash;it is hot,&mdash;but because I think I may possibly need it as a kind
of cushion for my saddle before the day is over. The need was felt, and
SORELY felt quite early in the afternoon; but most of the time we rode
too rapidly for my overcoat to supply the need,&mdash;it just would not stay
where I had hoped it might serve me well. So it happened that I was
destined to experience on that ride such misery as I had scarcely
thought one could endure. But, I anticipate.
</P>

<P>
We are ready. I am anxious to be going. I am delighted when my horse, a
beauty, indeed, and of pure Arabian stock, is led up by two dusky sons
of the desert. Surely my long trip to Jerusalem will be one of pleasure
when I am mounted on such a steed! At half-past twelve o'clock we
mount, and, facing to the south, we set off at a brisk pace for Gerasa,
(known to the Arabs as Jerash,) where it has been planned that we shall
spend the night. Several of the natives accompany us a short distance
on foot, one running on either side of my horse and holding to the
bridle; but soon, with interesting and graceful salaams, they leave us
to pursue our hot and dusty way alone.
</P>

<P>
There are just three of us, and we proceed in the following order: my
dragoman, who is guide and interpreter, leads the way; I follow next
after him; bringing up the rear is our muleteer, who takes charge of
all luggage, cares for the horses, and especially for,&mdash;me. Why should
I not be happy? For the first time in my life I have two men engaged to
look after my wants. They did their duty well,&mdash;were almost painfully
attentive at times. But to-day I thank them for their kind severity.
</P>

<P>
Not having spent more than a few hours on horse-back in the previous
ten years, I found, after riding a few miles, that it required more
than a beautiful horse to make riding comfortable to an inexperienced
rider. But our way led through such a beautiful valley, and on either
hand were mountains so suggestive of Bible narrative that there was
much in the earlier part of the afternoon to divert my attention from
any physical discomfort. Where we were riding there was no
road,&mdash;simply bridle-paths, and frequently not even a path.
</P>

<P>
After we had been riding for an hour a young Arab on camel-back joined
us. I did not like his searching looks from a face almost hidden in his
head-garment. But he stayed with us for a half-hour, and in that time
had raced his camel with our horses; then he suddenly turned from us
toward the near mountains of Gilead. We met a number of caravans in the
earlier part of the afternoon, and I noted that every man that I saw
carried a gun, or some sort of sword, or large knife. They were ready
for defense, if occasion should arise.
</P>

<P>
About two o'clock we passed a "memorial heap," or cairn. Some tragedy
occurred there, and the custom of the region is that the passer-by
places reverently on the pile of rocks already formed an additional
stone. Elsewhere I had seen this done when it seemed to me the actor
was under the spell of a superstitious fear.
</P>

<P>
About the middle of the afternoon a soldier, full armed, dashes up to
us in a mad gallop, hands a message to my dragoman, and then as rapidly
rides back again. I am a little alarmed at this until I learn that he
has entrusted a writing to us to be delivered in Jerusalem. A little
later I see another soldier leave the group in which he is riding and
gallop ahead across the open way to the brow of a hill. There he
dismounts, lays down his gun, takes the robe, or blanket, on which he
rode, spreads it upon the ground, faces toward Mecca, and prostrates
himself in prayer. The prayer over, he dashes down to his party and
they are off like the wind.
</P>

<P>
About four o'clock we passed near a little village, the only place
where I saw a house on that long afternoon ride. It is not safe for any
one to live outside the villages; hence there are no isolated dwellings
in all this region. We did not halt for one moment, but kept pressing
steadily on.
</P>

<P>
After five o'clock the plain was deserted; we saw from that time
neither man nor beast. I was cramped and painfully tired, and feeling
that if I could but walk for a few minutes it would be quite a relief,
I dismounted&mdash;quite a difficult thing to do and keep from sprawling
upon the ground. But I was no sooner off my horse than Haleel was
beside me, and my dragoman, who was at that time nearly a hundred yards
ahead of me, rode back and sternly commanded: "You get right back on
that horse; this is no time to think of walking; you can do that some
other time." Inwardly I resented it; how could I stand it longer! I
blamed it on the saddle, then I thought that they must have given me
the worst horse of the three. But all this helped nothing. They
assisted me again into the saddle. Then my guide delivered a little
speech in Arabic to Haleel. I did not then understand it, but shortly
after I learned the essence of it; it was, "You keep your eye on him
and see that he keeps his horse moving." When I found myself again in
the saddle I determined that if I must ride there would be no more
trotting of my horse,&mdash;I would proceed as gently as possible. But,
alas! Haleel had his whip and my dream of controlling my horse was
over. After that I kept close to my dragoman. At that time I thought it
harsh treatment, but later I understood.

We have reached the limit of level land and are now winding among the
eastern foot-hills of the mountains of Gilead. It is the hour of sunset
and the great orb of day sinks in sad beauty to me. In the twilight I
see here and there half-buried pillars of some famous temple&mdash;a temple
that surely never stood here. Our horses are wet with sweat; we have
not halted for lunch; not a drop of water has been seen; night is
coming on with its pale moon casting weird shadows about us; we are
alone in a land noted for its lawlessness, and yet we are unarmed. We
move on almost in silence. There is silence about us, save for the cry
now and then of some night-bird. We see no lights save those above us.
My guide seems bewildered and uncertain as to the location of the town
we seek. I am faint from weariness, and so cramped that at times it is
with difficulty that I keep from falling to the ground. I am now quite
solicitous as to our safety and not a little alarmed when our way leads
through some rocky, narrow passage suggestive of a lurking-place for
men of evil intent. But at last, at half-past nine o'clock, after being
in the saddle for nine hours, I am aroused from my stupor by a joyful
exclamation from my dragoman. A few dim lights are seen,&mdash;IT IS GERASA!
</P>

<P>
My dragoman continued his exclamations of praise thus, "I thank my God
for saving my life once more." I said faintly, "Why such words?"
"Well," he said, "all natives are expected to be in their villages by
sundown, tourists at their destination earlier. It is the custom of
this region that tourists must have an escort of soldiers or Bedouins,
even in times of peace; and now THE FEUDS ARE ON; and here we have come
alone, at night, unarmed; and I am responsible for these horses&mdash;they
are not mine&mdash;and for your life. The ride may have been hard for you,
but the hours of anxiety were more trying to me. I have now done it
once, but I'll never again assume such a risk&mdash;NOT EVEN FOR A MILLION
POUNDS!" I had no response that he heard, but mentally I said, "Never
again with ME, Mr. Barakat. NO, NEVER!"
</P>

<P>
Yet I think I never experienced greater joy on entering my own home
than on that night when entering and riding through the crooked, narrow
lanes of that miserable village of Gilead.

CHAPTER IV.
</H3>

<P>
Though in the village, and therefore relieved of the feeling of special
danger, yet we had much difficulty in securing lodging for the night.
Our arrival seemed to disturb the peace of dogdom in what otherwise
would have been a quiet resting-place. No people were outside their
houses. We picked our way to the nearest light; the occupant of the
house would not come out, but showed his face at the window&mdash;a hole in
the wall about a foot square. My dragoman pleaded for lodging, but in
vain. We sought the next house in which there was a light, but neither
would the people of that home open to us. We tried several other
places, but at all of them we were refused admission. They seemed to
look with suspicion upon our visit to the village. But, finally, a good
old Mohammedan consented to let us spend the night in his rock hut, and
gave us the privilege of putting our horses in his little walled space
by the house. Haleel must spend the night in this yard&mdash;he always slept
with the horses. When my dragoman helps me over the stone door-sill,
and we enter the hut, we find that the part allotted to men consists of
but one small room, having a floor of earth on which are spread a
couple of mats. In this room there is no furniture. Two persons are
already asleep on the floor. We do not disturb them.
</P>

<P>
Not having eaten anything since noon, my dragoman begins at once to
prepare a light lunch for us. On a brazier that he finds here he makes
a little charcoal fire and quickly brews some of the tea brought from
Damascus; into this he squeezes lemon juice; then finding some bread
that he had stowed away in his saddle-bags, our lunch is ready. I sit
on the floor as comfortable as I can make myself while he is getting
supper. The flickering light, the shifting shadows, the strange ones
lying asleep, the almost as strange dusky helpers, the sense of dangers
just escaped, the whining, wailing, barking dogs, my physical pain&mdash;all
these things beget within me a strange feeling of loneliness and a
longing for home. Again and again I ask myself the question, "Why did
you undertake this; why were you not content to go down from Damascus
to Galilee and all of West Palestine by the easy way?" But, again and
again I say to myself: "You would never have been satisfied had you
done so; this is part of the price to be paid for what you wanted;
consider what you get in exchange, value received."
</P>

<P>
But my reverie is cut short by a groan from my dragoman; he sank back
trembling and said, "Call Haleel!" Together we worked with him for a
half-hour or more until a chill, the result of drinking too much water
on reaching the village, had been overcome. I was much alarmed at the
possible outcome of his sudden illness, for had he left me thus the
situation for me would have been one of extreme perplexity. In my
anxiety for him I forgot for the moment my own condition. But now I am
again a conscious sufferer. So tired am I that I can scarcely wait
until I have sipped a little tea and eaten a little bread before I have
removed hat and shoes and am stretched out upon the floor to sleep. The
horses seem restless in their stamping; the dogs keep up their barking;
the room is dark; I hear the heavy breathing of those about me; a lone
star peeps in through the small window; and I try to compose myself for
the rest that I so much need. "Is there no balm in Gilead?" Yes. I
thought that I was lying down to a night of restlessness and fever, but
never on couch of down has my rest been sweeter.
</P>

<P>
I am awakened at dawn by some one moving about in the room, and I see a
man pick up a gun and pass quickly out. The dogs are barking savagely
throughout the village. Then I look about me. Imagine my surprise when
I discover that I have had five bed-fellows, or rather FLOOR-FELLOWS!
There we lay stretched out in all sorts of angles and curves&mdash;American,
Syrian, Circassian; Christian and Mohammedan&mdash;forming a kind of crazy
patch-work on the earthen floor. And imagine my supreme disgust when I
discover a big, dirty, odorous, unshod human foot, erect on the heel
and with toes spread out like a fan, within a few inches of my face!
Bah! How was it that I slept! I turn my face to the wall and soon lose
thought of the disturbing vision in slumber.
</P>

<P>
It is quite late when again I wake. The host is sitting on his mat near
me fumbling beads and chanting prayers. Without moving I watch him for
a while and note that he is also interested in me, and that he now
knows that I am awake. I begin an investigation of myself, and find, to
my glad surprise, that while I am stiff and sore I feel quite
refreshed. I dress myself&mdash;a simple matter this morning, simply putting
on my shoes&mdash;and while my dragoman prepares our breakfast I exercise
myself somewhat by walking down to an old Roman bridge spanning the
small stream flowing through the village. In this half-hour I get a
good general knowledge of the location of the town, its outline, its
magnificent ruins, etc. But I am not ready yet for sight-seeing. I
prefer to listen to the brook singing its happy way almost hidden among
the pink oleanders that grow in such profusion along its sides. The
running water, the perfume of the flowers, the flood of sunlight&mdash;these
are like balm to me after my awful yesterday. Certainly I shall be
ready early to study the ruins of this wonderful, mysterious, ancient
city.
</P>

<P>
Breakfast is ready. It consists of boiled eggs, bread, cheese, and tea.
Our table is the floor on which we slept. The male members of the
house-hold join us as we sit on mats around the simple meal. Our host
sends one of the men (a visitor to a Mohammedan home never meets, and
frequently never sees a woman) to bring a little of his own bread. It
does not look at all tempting to me, but I am told that if I wish to
secure my host's friendship I must eat of it. This I do, but only once,
and now he would be almost willing to die for me should occasion arise.
</P>

<P>
After breakfast he shows me some antique coins that he had found, and
when my guide explains that I am an American schoolmaster, he manifests
exceedingly his delight. He almost pulls me out into his little yard
where he had been digging, and where he had unearthed an inscribed
cylindrical block of marble about two feet in diameter and four feet in
length. The lettering is in Greek. He thinks it must tell of hidden
treasure. And so it does to me, but not of the kind for which he is
looking. The inscription is partially effaced, but I see enough to
conclude that it was likely at one time the pedestal of a statue.
</P>

<P>
I next proceed to take a further general view of this celebrated
locality&mdash;celebrated, for here are the most noted ruins east of the
Jordan. My first observation is that the present inhabitants,
Circassians, are rapidly despoiling the treasures of antiquity found
here. They take the rocks and pillars of temples that were once the
admiration of a great region and pile them roughly together, forming a
small enclosure; then, in many instances, they place poles and brush
across the top, throw ground on the brush,&mdash;and their houses are ready
for occupancy. There is no regularity whatever in the plan of the
alleys, or lanes, of the present village. We mount our horses for a
further study of these interesting ruins.
</P>

<P>
Gerasa was one of the chief cities of the Decapolis, (the other nine
were Damascus, Hippos, Scythopolis, Dion, Pella, Kanatha, Raphana,
Gadara, and Philadelphia,) and was situated twenty miles east of the
Jordan on one of the northern tributaries of the Jabbok, and within
five miles of the place where the famous "Moabite Stone" was found.
Tristam considers it to-day as "PROBABLY THE MOST PERFECT ROMAN CITY
LEFT ABOVE GROUND." The present ruins seem to date back to the second
century of the Christian era. A Christian bishop from Gerasa attended
the Council of Seleucia in 359 A.D., and another that of Chalcedon in
451 A.D. In the thirteenth century this city was in ruins. It was then
for five centuries lost to the eyes of the civilized world. In the
beginning of the thirteenth century a German traveler visited it; the
magnificent ruins of the place amazed him. The same ruins to-day, or
some of them, strike the comparatively few visitors with awe at the
thought of the riches, the gayety, and the power that once reigned here
on the border of the desert.
</P>

<P>
The walls of the ancient city are plainly traceable, and formed an
enclosure about a mile square. Three of its gates are fairly well
preserved. On the south side of the city ruins, less than a half mile
distant, stands a triumphal arch forty feet high. Between this arch and
the city wall are the ruins of a great stone pool and of a circus. The
main street lies on the west side of the stream. It was paved; yet
shows ruts worn into the stones by chariot wheels; and was lined on
each side with a row of rock columns above twenty feet in height, some
of which have capitals representing a high degree of artistic skill in
their planning and execution. Part of this street was arcaded behind
the columns where was the sidewalk. Fronting upon this street were vast
temples and baths, which, though fallen, are yet grand in their ruins.
All along this way lie great blocks of stone and marble and fallen
columns, so numerous that at times our progress is almost barred. But
not all of the columns are fallen; more than two hundred yet stand on
their original bases. About mid-way along the street it is crossed at
right angles by another which is also lined with columns. Farther on
toward the south it widens into an oval-shaped forum a hundred yards
long, surrounded with Ionic pillars in their original positions.
</P>

<P>
Just beyond the forum, elevated somewhat, is a large, well-preserved
temple; and immediately to the right of the temple is a theater built
in the hill-side with seats, stage, and other parts plainly
distinguishable. It is easy to sit in one of these empty benches and
see, as a shadow out of the past, a lively scene presented on the now
deserted stage&mdash;the voice of eloquence rings clear out of the dead
centuries, the play-house resounds with the applause of the shades that
fill the seats about me&mdash;and, then, the curtain of mystery is dispelled
by the bright sunlight that floods all the landscape, and I see nothing
but ruins everywhere. The play is over. The shades have gone again to
their long home.
</P>

<P>
On a commanding position in the north-west quarter stood temples of
vast proportions whose spacious courts, tottering walls, and forsaken
altars speak in eloquent terms of a glory long since departed.
Evidently this was a populous city, for it possessed two theaters
capable of seating many thousands of people. That it was a religious
city, and much given to idolatry, its temples and altars declare.
</P>

<P>
While Josephus speaks of the capture of this city by Alexander
Jannaeus, about 85 B.C., we look in vain for a mention of it in the
Bible. But some recent investigators, notably Dr. Merrill, (with whom I
had the pleasure and honor of conversing,) incline to the opinion that
Gerasa was the original Ramoth-gilead. Dr. Merrill gives six arguments
in favor of his position, which, after my observations made in the
place itself, I feel like accepting.
</P>

<P>
If this were Ramoth-gilead, then how much of Bible story clusters about
the spot! It was a "city of refuge"; and over these hills or up and
down this valley rushed the accidental man-slayer to seek refuge within
its gates from the blood-thirsty pursuer. Here Ahab was slain (I. Kings
22:34-37), here Ahaziah and Jehoram defeated Hazael (II. Kings 8:28,
29; 9:14), and here Jehu was anointed king of Israel and rode forth in
a chariot to execute his terrible commission concerning the house of
Ahab (II. Kings 9:4-26).
</P>

<P>
Gerasa! Beautiful, though in ruins. What glory must once have been
thine! But where are the warriors who passed in triumph through thy
gates? Where are the builders of thy temples? Where are the the priests
who ministered at thy altars? Where are the devotees who bowed at thy
shrines? Where are the people who thronged thy theaters and trod thy
beautiful streets? The hills over which man walked are still here; the
rocks that he quarried, carved, polished, and fitted into place are
here; the stone coffin in which he lay down to his last resting-place
is here&mdash;but where is HE? Gone! gone forever! Surely, how frail is man!
How fleeting his glory! As the waters of thy stream flow on to the Sea
of Death, so has the tide of life which swept through thy streets
passed on to the grave and oblivion.

CHAPTER V.
</H3>

<P>
Passing out over the fallen western wall of Gerasa we are immediately
in the ancient cemetery, which extends for a mile, or nearly so, from
the city. Many stone sarcophagi, some of which are artistically carved,
lie scattered about in almost every conceivable position&mdash;some even
lying across the tops of others. But these windowless rock-palaces are
all empty.
</P>

<P>
Leaving Gerasa, my way leads in a general direction westward over the
mountains of Gilead. The reader must remember that in all this region
there is not a road over which a carriage can be driven, save that
quite recently a few trips have been made from Mezarib to Gerasa. What
are called roads are simply bridle-paths, and, in many cases, the paths
are so indistinct that the guide is more likely to take you forward
with reference to a general direction than to attempt to lead you by a
recognized trail.
</P>

<P>
The Mountains of Gilead present a rugged appearance, but, in the main,
are clothed with vegetation; hence they are beautiful in their majesty.
The olive and the prickly oak are abundant. The villages are not
numerous, and are situated far up the slopes, or even on the tops of
the ridges. These villages are clusters of squalid huts constructed of
stone and mud, and can afford no accommodation such as an American
might desire. But, in many instances, they occupy sites identified with
places and events noted in Bible story.
</P>

<P>
These mountains were given to Gad in the allotment of Joshua and
Eleazar. Surely at that time the prospect must have been much more
pleasing than at present, or the Gadites would not have been so anxious
to receive this district as a permanent possession. True, even now, a
few narrow valleys, or wadies, show signs of great fertility, but the
greater part is quite uninviting. Yet to the tourist there is much of
interest in this region.
</P>

<P>
My way to the Jordan lay over these mountains, especially that part
known as the Jebel Ajlun. Sometimes it seemed impossible to proceed
because of rocks and underbrush. The mountain sides were so steep in
some places that we were barely able to climb them; many of the wadies,
washed by winter torrents, were next to being impassable; and when our
way led along the sides of precipitous slopes I shuddered to think of
the consequences of a misstep upon the part of my horse. The course I
had chosen through this East-Jordan country was an unusual one (as
already noted)&mdash;one over which my dragoman had never gone, and one over
which, he said, not one in a thousand tourists to Palestine ever asked
to go,&mdash;a statement corroborated by the United States Consul at
Jerusalem, who has written extensively on the trans-Jordanic highlands.
This statement was not very encouraging to me, but I had set my heart
on reaching the Jordan by this route, so simply said, "Lead on."
Several times I feared I had made a serious mistake, but having come
thus far I could not go back. After we had passed through the old
cemetery our ascent was gradual until we reached the modern village of
Suf, three miles northwest of Gerasa. Here we see "two women grinding
at the mill." The mill consists of two circular stones about fourteen
inches in diameter, the one stone rests upon the other, and the grain
to be crushed between them is supplied by one of the women while the
other turns the upper stone round and round, thus grinding the meal for
the uninviting bread of their less inviting floor-table.
</P>

<P>
This place has been suggested by Major Condor as the probable site of
Mizpah in Gilead. A group of fine stone monuments, in ruins, is yet to
be seen here. If this be the location of Mizpah then here is the place
where Jacob and Laban made their covenant of lasting peace, and erected
the "heap of witness" (Gen. 31:44-52), saying, "The Lord watch between
me and thee when we are absent one from another." Then they parted,
Laban going back to Mesopotamia and Jacob pressing on with anxious
heart toward the near Jabbok and the farther lands of his estranged
brother Esau.
</P>

<P>
Inspired by the covenant at Mizpah, and with a desire to help others to
establish covenants of peace, and to accept with cheerful resignation
enforced separation from loved ones, a recent writer, Julia A. Baker,
has written beautifully the following poem entitled "Mizpah":

If this place were Mizpah, then here Jephthah lived; and here, when he
went out to fight against the Ammonites, he made the vow to sacrifice
whatsoever should come forth out of the doors of his house to meet him
on his return from the battle, if the Lord would only give him the
victory. The battle was fought, and Jephthah triumphed. The glad news
reached his home; and out from his house rushed his daughter, his only
child, with timbrels and with dances, to meet her hero-father, not
knowing the nature of his vow made on the eve of the battle. Her
presence caused the brave warrior to tremble with horror and rend his
clothes when he remembered his vow. The daughter was dismayed&mdash;instead
of a smile of joy from her father she read her doom in his blanched and
contorted face. And somewhere on these hills round about the voice of
wailing arose for two months from many maidens because Jephthah must
fulfill his rash vow by sacrificing his only child. But he did unto her
according to his word; and annually thereafter for a period of four
days these hills resounded with the voice of weeping&mdash;the weeping of
the maidens of Mizpah over the sad fate of Jephthah's daughter. (Judges
11.)

Farther on we ascend a high ridge and then begin our descent into the
southern branch of the wady of Ajlun. After winding about for some time
among the rocks and brush in the dry bed of this wady we finally halt
at Ain Jenneh, a good, strong fountain issuing from under a great rock.
We are yet in the upper reaches of the wady and near the present
village of Ajlun. Here we lunch and rest an hour.

Some authorities identify this region as the place where was the "wood
of Ephraim." That being true, it is the place where Absalom lost his
life. Certain it is, even to-day, that to leave the little path that we
are following would mean to become hopelessly entangled in jungles of
prickly oak and other growth. Even in the path it is with difficulty
that I keep my garments from being torn from me.
</P>

<P>
If this be the location of the "wood of Ephraim," then here the forces
of Absalom under Amasa and the armies of David under Joab fought in
those trying days of David's exile. Only a few miles away, at Mahanaim,
David sent out his men, commanding that they touch not the young man.
Then he waited for the news of the conflict. In the thickets of Gilead
the first "battle of the wilderness" was fought. It was a decisive
engagement. Joab's veterans of many wars were too strong for the
rebel's army. Absalom sought safety in flight, but in trying to ride
hurriedly through the wild tangle his head caught in the branches of a
great oak, and before he could extricate himself, Joab had found him
and thrust him through the heart; then Joab's ten armor-bearers
encompassed the unfortunate victim and finished the deadly work. And
then, though Absalom had reared for himself a beautiful monument in the
king's dale at Jerusalem, they took his body from the tree and threw it
into a pit near by and made a great heap of stones over it. There was
no weeping at the grave of Absalom.
</P>

<P>
With the death of Absalom the rebellion was at an end; but David's
heart was broken. He waited at the gate of the city, more interested in
the welfare of his son than in the success of his army. Swift runners
approach! In answer to his question, "Is the young man safe?" he hears
reply that pierces his heart like a dagger. Up to his chamber over the
gate the king slowly passed weeping and bent with grief, and as he went
he said, "O my son Absalom! my son, my son Absalom! Would God I had
died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
</P>

<P>
A poet's conception of David's great grief on hearing of the death of
his son is portrayed in the following lines of N. P. Willis:
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
    Alas! my noble boy! that thou shouldst die!<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thou, who wert made so beautifully fair!<BR>
    That Death should settle in thy glorious eye,<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And leave his stillness in thy clustering hair!<BR>
    How could he mark thee for the silent tomb?<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My proud boy, Absalom!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
    Cold is thy brow, my son! and I am chill,<BR>

    How was I wont to feel my pulses thrill,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Like a rich harp-string, yearning to caress thee,<BR>

</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
    But death is on thee. I shall hear the gush<BR>

But this fountain! What birds and beasts here drank undisturbed before
man came to assert his lordship! What multitudes of people here have
drunk from the days before Israel down to the present time&mdash;the hunter,
the tiller of the soil, the grape-gatherer, the shepherd with his
flocks, the warrior and his chief,&mdash;all rejoiced and rested here, and
were refreshed and strengthened by the water.
</P>

<P>
Almost with reverence we drink again; then we remount our horses and
proceed along the wady past the village of Ajlun where an Arab joins us
and guides us on over fertile patches of ground and through olive
groves until we reach the modern town of Coefrinje, a town that
probably contains several thousand inhabitants. It is in the midst of
an olive grove well up on the side of the mountains. Here, although it
is scarcely past the middle of the afternoon, we stop for the night. It
is too far to the next village to risk going ahead&mdash;the way is none too
safe, even by day.
</P>

<P>
Several times to-day I could clearly distinguish the remains of old
Roman roads, well paved, and with curbing arrangement excellently
preserved. What vast sums of money and what great amount of labor must
have been expended on these old high-ways of the time when this
territory was occupied by the Romans! And where Rome walked she left
her path well made, and she left the impress of her thought in
rock-paved road, or in the lasting marble of her pillared temples and
carven tombs.

CHAPTER VI.
</H3>

<P>
Soon after entering the village of Coefrinje my dragoman had the rare
good fortune to find a former acquaintance, but whom he did not know to
be in those mountains. His name was Elias Mitry, who, with his wife,
had come up from Jerusalem to do missionary work under the auspices of
the Church of England. Although he was a native of Palestine and talked
very poor English, yet he offered us a welcome to his humble home than
which no more royal was accorded us anywhere. The meeting with my
dragoman was an exhibition of genuine joy, and he seemed equally
pleased to have me in his home; especially did he consider it an honor
to be my host when my dragoman told him that he was escorting a
"school-master" through the land. In that land it seems that the
teacher is almost reverenced because of his profession, while, it may
be said by way of contrast, in some sections of my home land he is
scarcely respected because of his profession. Indeed, I was treated as
a guest of honor; the best that the home afforded was at my service.
Stuffed cucumbers, figs, olives, pomegranates, and what, for want of a
better name, I call "congealed grape-juice,"&mdash;all these were placed
before me when in the early evening they aided my guide in serving
supper.
</P>

<P>
We spent little over four hours in the saddle to-day, so I am not
wearied, and I can give interested attention to the surroundings. And
there is much to interest me here. For, while the name "Coefrinje" is
not mentioned in the Bible, nor is its site definitely identified with
the location of any biblical city, yet there is much of Bible story
centered at points within five miles of this town.
</P>

<P>
Just across the narrow valley, only a few hundred yards distant, is the
height, Kulat er Rubad. It is crowned with the ruins of an old
castle-fortress called (together with the peak on which it stands) the
"watch-tower of Gilead." The view from the dismantled ramparts is not
excelled in this part of the world. It, indeed, rivals the view from
the celebrated peak south of the Jabbok, Jebel Osha. Dr. Thomson says,
"In reality this prospect includes more points of biblical and
historical interest than any other on the face of the earth." And Dr.
Merrill, after enumerating many of the famous characters of history
that moved under the gaze of this mount of out-look, adds, "The view is
more than a picture. It is a panorama of great variety, beauty, and
significance." To me it is wonderfully impressive.
</P>

<P>
As the evening wore on I first gave attention to the large olive-press
close to the mission-house. The press was simple in construction,
consisting of a large bowl-shaped rock from the center of whose
depression rose an upright post of wood; to this post was fastened a
long nearly-horizontal beam, not unlike what might be seen in the
old-time cider-mill or cane-mill; slipped onto this beam by means of a
large hole in its center was a large stone shaped like a grind-stone;
this rock, pushed well up to the post, rested in the bowl of the other
rock. When the natives pushed or pulled the beam around in tread-mill
fashion the circular stone turned on the beam, and at the same time
moved round and round in the hollow of the other rock. Thus the olives
placed in the bowl-shaped rock were thoroughly crushed and the oil was
caught in vessels.
</P>

<P>
Then I watch the shepherds leading their large flocks of sheep and
goats in from the mountain pastures to their folds for the night. All
day these faithful guardians have been with their flocks seeking good
pasture and water for them,&mdash;no easy task in the fall of the year near
the end of the dry season. They have guarded the sheep from the danger
of beast, or precipice, or pit; have released those caught in the
under-brush; have ministered to the needs of the sick; and now as night
approaches they come leading&mdash;not driving&mdash;their flocks in quiet
movement from out the mountain-paths to the sheltering fold in the
village for the night, again to lead them forth on to-morrow, and to do
likewise day after day. To see the tender solicitude of the Oriental
shepherd for his sheep adds much to one's appreciation of the beauty
and fitness of the teaching of the Master in his parable of the Good
Shepherd.
</P>

<P>
But it is near the sunset hour of my only evening in these sacred
mountains. I seek a vantage-ground and watch the King of Day sink
slowly down to his couch of rest behind the western mountains and the
farther sea. Oh, how beautiful! The sky is ablaze with a glory
indescribable by mortal tongue. All space seems vocal with praise to
the God of love and beauty.
</P>

<P>
In the strange and peaceful quiet of that evening I felt the presence
of a mysterious, subtle influence stirring within me. In the shower of
gold flung out as a good-night to me, and as the star of evening smiled
down upon me in the purpling twilight and began calling her myriads of
companions to their sentry-posts to keep watch over me through the
hours of the night in that strange land, I felt, I think, the spirit of
the poetry,
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
    "Sunset and evening star,<BR>
    And one clear call for me," etc.,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
in its fullness. Indeed, the air seemed vibrant with a living
personality, which, without undue stretching of the imagination, I
recognized as the SPIRIT OF HISTORY come to tell me the wonderful story
of those wonderful mountains. Enraptured I listened.
</P>

<P>
SAID THE SPIRIT: "Long before Gad was attracted by these heights and
valleys, tribes of people lived here in their simplicity, yet in sin.
The land seemed not different from other lands. Here were towering
wooded mountain, rocky ravine, and strong-flowing fountain; here the
beast prowled among the rocks, the bird nested in the trees, and the
sweet-scented flowers graced all the landscape. The storms beat upon
the mountains and the waters rushed in madness to the valley in the
rainy season, and the sun scorched the vegetation and dried up the
fountains in the dry season. Thus in monotony centuries passed.
</P>

<P>
"But one day the God of heaven sent messengers to encamp here, and from
that time these mountains on which you now stand have been considered
sacred&mdash;because pressed by the feet of angels. Yonder to the northeast,
only a little way, is where that event took place. Jacob, rich in herds
and flocks, was on his way home from far-off Euphrates, but he was much
troubled at the thought of meeting his brother who had sought to take
his life about twenty years previously. He was picking his way slowly
over these mountains leading his company and cattle when there appeared
in his way a host of angels. He was not frightened, but in gladness of
heart he cried out, 'Mahanaim,'&mdash;God's host. And although the wise
people of your day are not quite sure as to the exact location of this
meeting, yet be happy in the thought that you are now only a few miles
from the sacred spot, if, indeed, you are not just where it occurred.
Had you then stood here you could have seen the glorious light of their
presence, and could almost have heard the rustle of their heaven-plumed
pinions.
</P>

<P>
"After this meeting Jacob wandered a little farther to the south, and
just over yonder, on the Jabbok, he spent a whole night in prayer and
in wrestling with the Angel Jehovah, thinking it was a mere man. There
he gained a great victory over self, and he received the new name,
'Israel.' And on the next day, a little farther to the south, he met
his erst-while angry and murderous brother in peace and happy
reconciliation.
</P>

<P>
"A few centuries pass. Then the mighty Moses conquers all this region;
and a little later these Ajlun Mountains were given to the tribe of Gad
as a permanent home. But, in the course of time, the native tribes
prove troublesome; and then the great Gideon, having gained a decisive
victory down in the valley, followed the fleeing enemy, 'faint, yet
pursuing,' right through this very district. Later the Ammonites were
punished in a great battle by Israel's 'out-cast,' and mighty warrior,
Jephthah.
</P>

<P>
"But look again at Mahanaim where Jacob met the angels. The place in
later centuries became a center of other events of interest. There,
after the death of Saul, Ish-bosheth established his capital, and forth
from its gates he sent his armies under Abner to fight that he might
secure the scepter of all Israel to himself. But after two years of
struggle he was treacherously slain and his cause was hopelessly lost.
There, too, David sought refuge from Absalom; and out from those same
gates through which Ish-bosheth had sent armies against him, David sent
armies against his own son. And there above one of the gates of
Mahanaim the voice of his weeping arose when he heard the news of the
death of his strange misguided boy.
</P>

<P>
"Time passed on and the Israelites turned from the God of heaven to
worship at the shrines of other gods. Then, to punish them for their
sin God sent a strange invader into these mountains who carried away
the people by thousands into cruel captivity in a land far toward the
sun-rising.
</P>

<P>
"Later the Romans came and planted olive trees and built fine cities
and established enduring roads. But Rome is fallen, and where she moved
in power and splendor ruin only remains, and the unambitious, ignorant
Bedouin feeds his flock and lives in idleness amidst broken down
terraces and thorn-covered fertile soil. Desolate! Yes, dark is the
picture. But, what of the night? Take your place again on the
'watch-tower of Gilead' and scan well the horizon. Yes, it is well; the
morning cometh!"
</P>

<P>
Having given myself up to reverie and to communing with the SPIRIT OF
HISTORY, as it were, I was for a time forgetful of my surroundings. The
twilight had deepened when I again turned my thoughts to the village
and its people. I look up at some of the houses near me and see a
number of the natives in their dark robes standing like statues on the
flat roofs of their homes, yet watching every movement of the stranger
that has so unexpectedly appeared in their midst. I do not fear them,
but somehow a feeling of unrest steals over me; they seem like shades
of departed Israelites back again from their long sleep. In the
gathering gloom I pass quickly into the mission-house near by.
</P>

<P>
This proves to be an evening full of interest to me. I learn that a
mission-service is soon to begin, and that a number of the villagers
will be here for the service. I am impressed with the quiet (save for
the barking of dogs) that prevails in these Arab villages. I see no
drunkenness, and there is no boisterous rudeness of other sort.
</P>

<P>
In a little while a score or more of men come quietly to the
mission-house, remove their sandals, pass into the room, and seat
themselves on the earthen floor against the walls. Mrs. Mitry beckons
to me to come to the door; she wanted me to see that row of forty
sandals. She said in her broken way that it was interesting to her, and
she thought it would interest me.
</P>

<P>
It is only a little while until Mr. Mitry enters and takes his place at
a small table in the center of the room. A half hour or more is spent
in smoking cigarettes&mdash;almost every native smokes. Here it seems that
the habit is in no sense considered a vice. Indeed, the missionary
himself, not only smokes, but assists in making cigarettes for the
others. They smoke and smoke until the room is so darkened that we see
each other but dimly through the haze. I am surprised that I can endure
it. The tobacco must be different from that used in America, for
ordinarily a single cigarette is more offensive to me than was the
smoke of nearly fifty on that evening&mdash;for some of the men smoked two
or three apiece in that close room.
</P>

<P>
After the smoking was over black coffee was served in small cups
holding about one-fourth as much as the average teacup. They sip this
slowly and talk. I note that frequently they are saying something about
"hawadje," and then they fix their eyes upon me. My dragoman tells me
that he has been explaining our hard trip to Gerasa, that they were
skeptical about it, but that he has convinced them of its verity.
</P>

<P>
But now it is time for the service. Mr. Mitry opens his Bible and reads
in Arabic the story of Moses' invitation to Hobab. Then he expounds the
Scripture for some time while the men listen with rapt attention. There
are some questions and answers. I understand only a word now and then,
but it is a picture of more than ordinary interest to me to look upon
the expectant, and then the satisfied faces of these natives.
</P>

<P>
When the lesson was over a request came from the men for me to speak to
them. Through my dragoman as interpreter I spoke a little while on the
theme of the evening, which meant much to me there where the migration
of Moses was in a measure felt by the early inhabitants. They listened
attentively, and when I had finished they told my guide to say to
"hawadje" that they wanted him to stay and make his home with them.
Then, the meeting over, they moved out into the darkness with graceful
"salaams," and with the promise of one of their number to accompany us
on the morrow. They said we must not go on alone.
</P>

<P>
The service-room is now to be my bed-room. A pallet is brought to me,
and on it I am soon trying to sleep. But the beautiful sunset, the
vision of the past of this region, the mission-service, the stillness
of the night&mdash;so still that the very silence seems audible&mdash;keep me
awake for some time. I am lying by the "watch-tower of Gilead." I seem
to see the Spirit of Prophecy standing on its broken battlements,
wrapped in the shadows of the night, looking hopefully toward the place
of sun-rising. I call to him, "Watchman, what of the night?" In sweet
tones of assurance comes the answer, "The morning cometh! The story of
the Christ will yet transform the darkness that rests here into the
brightness of noonday." Then a sweet peace seemed wafted into my soul
from out the unseen somewhere,&mdash;but certainly from Him who "giveth his
beloved sleep."

CHAPTER VII.
</H3>

<P>
It was early on the following morning when our horses were led around
to the door of the mission-house, but notwithstanding the early hour a
dozen or more of the natives were standing in line to receive medical
attention from the missionary. A few were there who seemed to have come
to witness our departure. Our guide, promised the night before, was on
hand, mounted, ready to lead the way over what proved to be by far the
roughest part of my trip. For that day my party consisted of four
persons. Our new leader, whose name I did not learn, was a man of about
fifty years, and was a genuine Arab in appearance and dress. But he
wore nothing on his feet&mdash;not even sandals. I felt better satisfied,
knowing that he would lead the way on that day, for my dragoman was not
familiar with that part of Gilead. However, when toward the middle of
the afternoon we descended into the Jordan Valley, he was quite at home
again.
</P>

<P>
Single file we proceed from Coefrinje along a narrow path with the
bushes and briars brushing the sides of our horses and wetting us with
dew. It is not long until we begin to ascend a high ridge. Here there
are no paths whatever, and at times our horses can scarcely move on
because of the steepness of the ascent. But a few minutes before nine
o'clock, after a toilsome struggle, we reach the summit of the ridge,
and here I get my first panoramic view of the west-Jordan country. It
is entrancingly beautiful.
</P>

<P>
When we had reined up our horses I said to my dragoman, "Tell our
attendants to be still until I have finished speaking; I want to
explain the scene before us." And then while he listened, and looked as
I directed, I said: "That towering height far to the north is Mount
Hermon; the sheet of water some miles on this side is the Sea of
Galilee; to the west of the Sea of Galilee is Hattin, the Mount of
Beatitudes; that white spot southwest of Hattin is Nazareth; that great
plain south of Nazareth is Esdraelon, the 'battle-field of Palestine';
these rounded mountains here in the eastern part of the Valley of
Esdraelon are Tabor, Little Hermon, and Gilboa;&mdash;on the north is Tabor,
at whose base Napoleon fought; the next is Little Hermon, where lived
the witch of Endor; and the one south of Little Hermon is Gilboa, where
Saul and his sons were slain; that range of mountains forming the
southern wall of Esdraelon is Carmel, where Elijah held his trial with
the priests of Baal; here below us, winding in its serpentine course,
is the Jordan in its great trough or Ghor; in the center of the picture
are the mountains of Samaria, with Ebal and Gerizim; to the south are
the mountains of Judea, where lies Jerusalem; and that broad expanse of
water beyond all these is the Mediterranean, the 'great sea toward the
going down of the sun.'"
</P>

<P>
Then I waited for his criticism. He said, "You are right in every
point, but how did you know?" I said, "It is just like the Palestine of
my childhood's fancy that I located in the field back of the barn on my
father's little farm in western Pennsylvania, and with that picture I
have been familiar from the days of my early youth." It is impossible
for me to express what were my feelings at this supreme moment of my
life, as I viewed for the first time what is distinctively known as the
land of Patriarch, Prophet, Priest, and King&mdash;the land of my Redeemer's
earthly pilgrimage&mdash;the world's best Holy Land! After some time spent
in viewing that almost matchless scene, and in gathering mountain
lilies, we began our descent into the most remarkable depression in the
world&mdash;the great Ghor of the Jordan. The next few hours afforded little
of pleasure. Careful attention had to be given to our horses as we
wound about among the rocks. The horses of both my dragoman and
muleteer fell on this trip, but without serious results to either
horses or riders. It was quite wearying to proceed thus, so when we
finally reached a large sloping rock under which was a kind of stagnant
pool&mdash;the only water we had seen since leaving Coefrinje&mdash;I was glad to
know that there we would lunch, even though I could not drink of the
water.
</P>

<P>
This rocky wady is like a prison-house to me. But while eating I hear
sweet strains of music somewhere on the mountains&mdash;it is from a
shepherd's pipe. Scanning the heights I see far above me shepherds with
their flocks of sheep and goats, and the music that I hear is from
their reed-harps which they play as they lead the way over rugged
mountain paths to find greener pastures and better waters.
</P>

<P>
We tarry here only a little while. Not long after lunch we pass a
grotto of small size in the hill-side. Evidently the carven ruins are
the remains of an ancient temple that stood here in the days when a
pagan people held possession of the land; and I feel sure that a
fountain must exist here a good part of the year, though now it is dry.
</P>

<P>
A little farther on is Jabesh-gilead. The story of Jabesh-gilead is a
touching one. The people of the city were besieged by the Ammonites
under their king, Nahash. The men of the city were willing to make a
covenant to serve the Ammonites. But Nahash told them that the only
condition on which he would make a covenant with them would be to
thrust out all their right eyes and lay it as a reproach upon Israel.
The elders of Jabesh asked a respite of seven days in which to get
help, which request was granted. The situation was critical in the
extreme. Messengers left the besieged city and hurried to the new king
of Israel. Saul heard the story of their distresses. Immediately he
gathered an army of three hundred and thirty thousand men, and,
marching rapidly up the Jordan Valley, crossed the river and attacked
the Ammonites and completely routed them with great slaughter. And thus
he saved the city.
</P>

<P>
The men of Jabesh-gilead never forgot Saul and his kindness to them.
Forty years later the disastrous battle of Gilboa was fought. In this
battle both Saul and Jonathan were slain. The next day when the
Philistines searched for spoils among the dead they found Saul and his
three sons, and they cut off his head to carry it as a trophy to
Philistia; but they took the headless trunks of the king and his sons
to Beth-shan and fastened them against its walls as a terrible warning
to the Israelites. But, "when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of
that which the Philistines had done to Saul, all the valiant men arose
and went all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons
from the wall of Bethshan and came to Jabesh and burnt them there. And
they took their bones and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and
fasted seven days." (II. Samuel 31:11-13.)
</P>

<P>
Off to the left a little way I see Tabakat Fahil, identified as Pella,
the place to which the Christians of Jerusalem fled just before the
siege of Titus in obedience to the prophetic warning of Christ.
</P>

<P>
It is two o'clock when we reach the Jordan Valley, at a point a little
south of Beth-shan, which is on the west side of the river. We now turn
northward and pursue our way steadily near the mountains until after
five o'clock; then we turn toward the river, which we reach at sun-down.
</P>

<P>
The Jordan Valley is covered with a growth of thorn said to be like
that used in the crowning of Christ at the time of his mock-trial. We
eat of a delicious yellow berry now ripening on these thorns. We pass
two or three small villages, the names of which I could not learn. We
cross a number of small streams this afternoon, the largest of which is
the Tayibeh. All of these streams are thickly lined with reeds and pink
oleander; so thick is this growth in some places that the streams are
completely hidden. Our Arab guide springs down into each of these
water-brooks and hands drink to us, but he drinks, I think, after the
manner of the drinking of "Gideon's three hundred," in the time of
their being tested; that is, by a quick movement of the hand throwing
water into his mouth.
</P>

<P>
Pushing rapidly across the open valley we startle gazelles from their
hiding-places among the reeds. Then, near the river, we pass several
encampments of Bedouins whose tents are black as those of Kedar. At
last, after being in the saddle all of ten hours, just at sun-set, we
reach the Jordan at the bridge of Jisr el Mejamia, six miles south of
the Sea of Galilee. Just across on the other side of the river we shall
tarry through the night.
</P>

<P>
The way has been long and trying. I am very weary. But, now, just
before me the Jordan&mdash;sacred stream! And then, on the other side, rest!
Happy, soul-cheering thought!

</H3>

<H3 ALIGN="center">
CHAPTER VIII.
</H3>

<P>
The bridge of Jisr el Mejamia was at the time of my visit the only
available one for travel between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea.
It is a stone bridge and was built by the Romans nearly, or quite, two
thousand years ago. It could scarcely be crossed by carriages at
present as the ascent to the highest point is by a kind of step
arrangement. It even seemed a wise precaution for us not to attempt to
ride over on horse-back&mdash;the stones were very smooth and slippery. The
present name of the structure means "bridge of the messengers," and it
was so named because here messengers from various points in the land
used to meet to exchange messages.
</P>

<P>
I am glad to reach this place, for again I am very tired. The distance
traveled to-day is said to be fifty miles. But when we arrive here the
road and bridge are crowded with sheep and goats being brought in from
the valley for safety in the night. My first sight of the Jordan, which
at this place is clear and sparkling, does not particularly impress me.
I long for rest, and so we do not tarry, but pass directly into the
village lying just at the west end of the bridge.
</P>

<P>
Oh, the wretchedness of this place! I wonder what kind of entertainment
I can find here. There is little choice as to a place of lodging. The
best and only accommodation that the miserable village affords is what
was formerly used by robbers as a prison-house for their victims, but
which is now used as a kind of store-room. There is but one room, and
its earthen floor is littered over with filth of almost every
description, while dust and cob-webs everywhere abound. This is the
RECEPTION-ROOM for our party of four.
</P>

<P>
While my dragoman busied himself in getting supper, I sat on a box
making notes of what I had seen and experienced that day. Just then the
place served as KITCHEN and WRITING-ROOM. I wrote rapidly, and as I
wrote the thought that somewhere that day I had crossed the path of the
Master in his Perean ministry thrilled me. I said, "Mr. Barakat, I am
going down to the Jordan for a while after supper." He replied, "All
right, and I'll go with you'." "No," said I, "I want to be alone down
at the bridge." He simply said, "I'll go with you."
</P>

<P>
Our supper was a light affair, but our host brought a platter of
something that looked like dark beeswax, but which proved to be a
palatable food called "halawa." We ate from the floor of this room,
which then became our DINING-ROOM.
</P>

<P>
After supper I was ready to go down to the river, not more than a
hundred yards from our lodging-place. When we started, our host stepped
to a corner of the room, picked up a gun, and prepared to go with us. I
told my dragoman to tell him not to go with us. The reply was, "He will
go with us." "Well," I said, "if he must go make him put down that gun;
it will spoil my evening of quiet thought at the sacred river." The
answer was: "Make no further objection. Have you not noticed that
everybody here carries a gun? He knows what he is doing. This is the
most disreputable place along the river. Those Bedouins of the black
tents that we passed over yonder would want no better opportunity than
to find you, who are expected to have money, alone at the bridge." I
accepted the situation, and said, "All right, but I shall expect you
both to be obedient to the extent of giving me a period of quiet as
long as I wish to remain."
</P>

<P>
But, before we go to the bridge, let me tell of that night in that
miserable place of filth. At the time of retiring my host said to me
through my interpreter that I could have choice of beds&mdash;that I could
either sleep on the counter, which consisted of a couple of boards laid
carelessly across boxes, or that I could sleep behind the counter on
the floor! After looking at the boards, and thinking what would likely
be the result should I attempt to sleep there, I made choice of the
floor. The room then became my BEDROOM.
</P>

<P>
Oh, that night! I did not sleep a half-hour. The place seemed alive
with vermin. My host slept on the counter. He did not seem to be
annoyed in the least. True, he scratched, but he snored an
accompaniment to his scratching throughout the night. I could only
scratch and listen to him; there was no snoring for me. After that
night it required frequent bathing and much searching for a week or ten
days before I felt free from the awful pests of that filthy den. Thus
it was that my first crossing of the Jordan did not bring me to a "land
of rest," but to an experience akin to distraction.
</P>

<P>
But now to the bridge. We pass quietly among the curious gazers down to
the river. Just south of the bridge I go down to the river's edge and
bathe my hands, face, and feet in water that only a few hours ago was
in the lake where the waves were once stilled by His quiet command of
power&mdash;"Peace, be still," and where He at another time walked amidst
the billows to meet his own; in water that will hurry on down the
valley to the place where He was baptized; and then it will pass on
into oblivion in the Salt Sea of Death. Then I try, with surprising
success, to drink of the water like our Arab guide drank to-day. Then
we walk to the bridge, at the approach of which I ask my men to tarry
while I go out on it alone to meditate.
</P>

<P>
I have reached this place by the expenditure of much physical energy. I
am very weary over my hard day in the saddle. But when I seat myself on
the highest point of the bridge, and give myself up to reverie, I feel
the flood of sentiment and rejoice. The moon is about one-half hour
above the mountains of Gilead; a halo seems to gild the heights to the
east and to the west. I am just above the Jordan; its rippling waters
tell me of Abraham, of Jacob, of Joshua, of Saul, of David, of Elijah,
of Elisha, of Naaman, of John the Baptist, and of Jesus of Nazareth.
How sweet and musical is the story! How impressive its truths as I hear
it to-night? Then I watch the play of the moon-light on the water,&mdash;the
glittering sheen on the smooth surface above the bridge, and the
flashes of light on the rapids below. It is all so beautiful!
</P>

<P>
And this is the Jordan! For many years I have heard of it; I have read
of it; I have sung of it. It has been to me for many years a type of
death. Again I look upon the calm blue depths on the north, and then
again on the rapids below&mdash;I see the peace here, and hear the rush
there. Then I turn my eyes again to the mountains, and upward to the
moon, and past the moon to the stars&mdash;and by faith beyond the stars to
search for Him of this land, because of whose earth-life I am here, and
upon whom I rely for support in the hour of my approach to the shore of
that river of which this is the type.
</P>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
